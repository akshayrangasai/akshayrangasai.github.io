I usually sort people into bins in my head, based on a few stereotypes, and one of the stereotypes happens to be the Resume Whore. In some sense, I could even be bitter about said resume whore because of their CGPA. I will, in chronological order try to break down life like a resume whore. Let’s see what life looks like from that side.

Resume Whores (Let’s call them the RWs) are extremely competent people. Their life choices are affected by only one thing. Whether they can see themselves writing the said thing on their resume, or not. From this it becomes fairly obvious as to why people clear JEE.

>    “Secured a Rank of XXX(X), which is the 0.001%ile in JEE”.

If that percentile number isn’t a resume point, I don’t know what is.

“RWs” realize that to really have that stellar resume, they need more than just the “IIT” tag. They need the branch too. People in branches below mechanical try to BC to mechanical and above (Why anyone would want to pursue mechanical engineering is beyond me, but hey, RWs know what they’re doing). This kills two birds with one stone. The CG requirement for most cut-offs is met, as is the branch which maximizes breadth of the placement graph (Yes, I am very bitter about my CGPA, in case you were wondering :( ). This wraps up semester one. Nothing else to pump up your resume with. Maybe a T5E correspondent here and an IAR vol there. Whatever it takes to network to the fullest.

Enter second year, and the RWs want to become Spons-Creatives. Or some fancy sounding name the spons cores give the “facebook like and share coordship”. This is where their journey to true whoring begins. Once they take up creative, they start whoring. They take up everything in sight. Leave no stone unturned. Build PR for themselves in insti as a very enthusiastic and stud second year destined for stardom, while chilling in their room, writing their resume with all the PoRs. During quizzes, they cease to have contact with the outside world and mug. People will notice their spam on facebook and a bunch of seniors who have started up will want your assistance in liking, sharing and promoting their page. (Pre-requisite is to be able to generate content. Which, sadly, most of the creatives suck at.) They will then take up another internship with a corporate at the same time and completely ignore the start-up. Resume points, bitches.

>    “Chief of online PR and marketing at GenStartup1 . Helped increase product adoption by over 300% through targeted online campaigns

In simple speak, the RW got (in the case of an app) 3 more people to sign up, to make it 6 people. Targeted online campaigns are basically facebook ads.

>    Interned at fancy corporation and worked on minimizing supply chain delays by more than 2% to ensure faster product movement to end consumer.

In simple speak, (s)he moved a chair in the office to make the workers go in a straight line and not around the chair.

This is all definitely understandable, who wouldn’t want to be successful and popular in life, right? Next is the quintessential “Who should I date” phase. If you are a normal human being, the obvious answer to that would be, “Someone I like”, but to them, it is on the lines of,

>    Dated <Name< for a <Time Period> and reached high levels of mental pleasure consistently. Was offered marriage proposal but denied to pursue career interest which lies in working for your company.

If that sentence looked good you with stuff substituted, I think you’ve been dating the wrong person.

After all this is done, it is Shaastra/Saarang time. The time to build contacts, meet those seniors that will help you get that coveted job at McKinsey and make friends. I’m not saying that RWs cannot make friends, just that their decisions are driven by how their friends will look on resume. In all this commotion, there will be the obligatory step into CFI and NSS to really get the social angle of their resume pumping. They’ll make it look like they are personally responsible for feeding the hungry children in Ethiopia or stopping civil war in Libya through their kind gestures and technological interventions.

>    Led a team of <X<10> members in a project to teach underprivileged school children robotics and bring science to school

I took my shitty CFI robot and showed it to a bunch of kids who act fascinated so that they can leave home quickly.

This is their first half in insti, and it forms the basic building blocks for the uber whoring they will be doing later on in life. It is sad, but I have been a whore too, only in my second year, though.

Then, there is another new breed of resume whore. The really illiterate ones, who take up GA coordships and try to sell it off as the most managerial coordships of the lot. If telling a bunch of grunts with IQ levels comparable to that of neanderthals is management, I should be a managing partner at McKinsey.
