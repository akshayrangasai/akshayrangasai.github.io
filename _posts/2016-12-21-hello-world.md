# Hello World

After some effort and a lot of cursing, I got the site up and running again. Just like any woman in a clothes shop, I just can't choose between online themes. Do I go for the minimalistic theme, or do I go for the no holds barred theme and modify it a bit.

This minimalistic theme works well for me, and hopefully, I will not change this further and pain myself. If you have any requests, please feel free to hit me up on the various communication channels I have plastered throughout the website.

Will just end this post with a quote, as I like markdown and this theme's quotations.

>A measure of a man is what he does with power
