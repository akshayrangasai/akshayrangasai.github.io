About a month ago (first week of November), I went on a trip to Norway to "chase" the Northern Lights (Arora Borealis), maybe see a couple of whales and sled down the mountains on husky power. There was no snowfall till the day I left (I did get snowflakes on my face, though) and so the husky plan didn't work out too well. After my 4 days there, I was **not** disappointed.
